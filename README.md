About Me

Hi there! I'm passionate about building projects that help people find meaning and reflect on their lives. My work focuses on creating tools and experiences that encourage deep thought, self-discovery, and connection.

Why Svelte?

I love using Svelte because of its simplicity, efficiency, and reactivity. It allows me to focus on what matters mostâ€”crafting intuitive and meaningful applications without unnecessary complexity.
